# How to Use the the current build
Node-webkit is bundedl with the application for development purposes. Read more about this here: https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/

##Windows:
- Simply run the `nw.exe` located in the root of the application.

##Mac/Linux
*untested* but should work fine.
- with node-webkit installed and the nw command in your `$PATH`, run `nw /path/to/app`
 - simply running `nw` while in the root of the application will also work.
